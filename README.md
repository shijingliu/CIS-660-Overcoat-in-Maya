CIS-660-Overcoat-in-Maya
========================
I cooperated with Nathan Zeichner to finish this project.   
Overcoat Maya is a system for modeling and matte painting artist to use their two dimensional painting skills and transform them into three dimensional scene. With this tool, artists can paint a scene using their traditional skills. 

Overcoat methods can be broken down into two separate sections: creation of strokes and the rendering of the strokes. Overcoat allows the user to draw splines and stipples onto the surface of a mesh creating the illusion of a painting.  The splines are drawn using a projection mechanism that mimics the brush in Photoshop.  The user can either define the splines in the direction of the normal (the hair tool) or in the direction of the plane (the feather tool).   The user can also draw on multiple scaled versions of the surface of the mesh using the level set tool.  This tool allows the user to directly apply color to a model like they are painting a sculpture.  The splines and stipples are then rendered as brush strokes with transparency, weight, thickness, color, and pattern.  Each spline is viewed as a series of stipples along a line.  Each stipple is then rendered facing camera.  Essentially each spline can be viewed as camera facing polygon strip with a texture.
